```{r augmenting-data}
#names(Country_codes)[names(Country_codes) == 'Three_Letter_Country_Code'] <- 'Country_code'
Olympics_complete <- Summer_Olympics %>%
  left_join(Country_codes, by = "Country_code") %>%
    mutate(Medal_value = case_when(
      Medal == "Gold" ~ 3,
      Medal == "Silver"    ~ 2,
      Medal == "Bronze" ~ 1
    )) 
```

```{r}
Summer_Olympic_medals_1976_to_2008 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Country, fill = Medal)) +
  geom_col(position = "fill") 
  scale_x_discrete(expand = c(0, 170)) +
```

```{r}
Summer_Olympic_medals_1976_to_2008 %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Year)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5000) +
  facet_wrap( ~ Country, ncol = 100)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
